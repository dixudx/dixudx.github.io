No matter the clusters are running on public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, or at the edge, Clusternet lets you manage/visit them all as if they were running locally. This also help eliminate the need to juggle different management tools for each cluster. Clusternet can also help deploy and coordinate applications to multiple clusters from a single set of APIs in a hosting cluster. Clusternet will help setup network tunnels in a configurable way, when your clusters are running in a VPC network, at the edge, or behind a firewall. Clusternet also provides a Kubernetes-styled API, where you can continue using the Kubernetes way, such as KubeConfig, to visit a certain Managed Kubernetes cluster, or a Kubernetes service.

So it is indispensable to monitor nodes status and detect node problems. Node problem detector (NPD), an open source project in Kubernetes community, is a good answer to address this issue. Nowadays NPD has already been well accepted and widely used in production environments. Actually identifying the problem is only the first step. What we need to do next is to handle those problems and rescue the nodes. In this talk, we will list common problems and share how we establish rules to decide whether a node is ready or not and how to fix them if recoverable. Moreover, we will introduce some use scenarios on how we make a 99.9% uptime guarantee with ten thousand nodes in a single cluster. We will share some experience on how to recover the nodes within 10 minutes as well.

Sidecars are coupled with normal containers by sharing the same lifecycle and provide accessory features. This is a good pattern to enable applications to be composed of heterogeneous components and technologies by reducing coupling. The demands of using sidecar containers in production environments are rapidly increasing, although sidecars have not formally identified. More issues and discussions have cropped up in Kubernetes community and slack channels. Thus, we need a fine-grained way to manage the sidecars, including the starting/terminating order, the lifecycle of sidecars, etc. Also pre and post steps are introduced to better control the sidecars. Moreover, we will introduce some use scenarios on how we maximize the power of sidecars at a large scale in Alibaba Group and Ant Financial.

Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. Since the group’s formation we have primarily focused on creating kubeadm, a streamlined installer tool and building block to simplify the installation and upgrade experience, and enhance kops, the easiest OSS way to get a production-grade Kubernetes cluster up and running in AWS. We have recently begun building a Cluster API to provide an abstraction of machines across different deployment environments along with a common control plane configuration. In this Deep dive session, we will review recent accomplishments, and discuss our future development plans, where you are very welcome to contribute to the discussion.
