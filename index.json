So it is indispensable to monitor nodes status and detect node problems. Node problem detector (NPD), an open source project in Kubernetes community, is a good answer to address this issue. Nowadays NPD has already been well accepted and widely used in production environments. Actually identifying the problem is only the first step. What we need to do next is to handle those problems and rescue the nodes. In this talk, we will list common problems and share how we establish rules to decide whether a node is ready or not and how to fix them if recoverable. Moreover, we will introduce some use scenarios on how we make a 99.9% uptime guarantee with ten thousand nodes in a single cluster. We will share some experience on how to recover the nodes within 10 minutes as well. ","date":"2020-08-20","objectID":"/kubecon-euro-2020-rescue-nodes/:1:0","series":[],"tags":[],"title":"Help!

Sidecars are coupled with normal containers by sharing the same lifecycle and provide accessory features. This is a good pattern to enable applications to be composed of heterogeneous components and technologies by reducing coupling. The demands of using sidecar containers in production environments are rapidly increasing, although sidecars have not formally identified. More issues and discussions have cropped up in Kubernetes community and slack channels. Thus, we need a fine-grained way to manage the sidecars, including the starting/terminating order, the lifecycle of sidecars, etc. Also pre and post steps are introduced to better control the sidecars. Moreover, we will introduce some use scenarios on how we maximize the power of sidecars at a large scale in Alibaba Group and Ant Financial.

Our SIG is trying to improve user experiences on bootstrapping a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. With our primarily installer tool, kubeadm, a streamlined installing and upgrading process can be well managed. We’ve recently introduced a new Kubernetes object, called Cluster API to bring declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration, and management. In this introduction session, we will present our SIG’s mission statements, review recent updates, and discuss our roadmaps. Some new lifecycle projects are introduced as well.

Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. Since the group’s formation we have primarily focused on creating kubeadm, a streamlined installer tool and building block to simplify the installation and upgrade experience, and enhance kops, the easiest OSS way to get a production-grade Kubernetes cluster up and running in AWS. We have recently begun building a Cluster API to provide an abstraction of machines across different deployment environments along with a common control plane configuration. In this Deep dive session, we will review recent accomplishments, and discuss our future development plans, where you are very welcome to contribute to the discussion.
